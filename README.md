# Experimental Comparison to Improve Performance of Spam Filter System

## Introduction

- This project is a project that will be held at Kyunghee University in Fall 2017 machine learning class.

- This project includes spam filtering using machine learning.
- In addition, you can see documents containing experiments that apply various parameters to spam filtering.

## Environment
- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Python 2.7
- tensorflow 1.3


## Data
The dataset you use is the "SMS Spam Collection Data Set" provided in the UCI repository.


## Reference
The code used in the experiment was created by <b>using the open source</b> of spam filtering using the existing RNN and modified according to the experiment environment.
